    "<p>Convolutional Neural Networks are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks from the previous chapter: they are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a loss function (e.g. SVM/Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular Neural Networks still apply.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>So what changes? ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network.</p>\n",

    "<p><em>Recall: Regular Neural Nets.</em> As we saw in the previous chapter, Neural Networks receive an input (a single vector), and transform it through a series of <em>hidden layers</em>. Each hidden layer is made up of a set of neurons, where each neuron is fully connected to all neurons in the previous layer, and where neurons in a single layer function completely independently and do not share any connections. The last fully-connected layer is called the “output layer” and in classification settings it represents the class scores.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><em>Regular Neural Nets don’t scale well to full images</em>. In CIFAR-10, images are only of size 32x32x3 (32 wide, 32 high, 3 color channels), so a single fully-connected neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular Neural Network would have 32*32*3 = 3072 weights. This amount still seems manageable, but clearly this fully-connected structure does not scale to larger images. For example, an image of more respectable size, e.g. 200x200x3, would lead to neurons that have 200*200*3 = 120,000 weights. Moreover, we would almost certainly want to have several such neurons, so the parameters would zadd up quickly! Clearly, this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters would quickly lead to overfitting.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><em>3D volumes of neurons</em>. Convolutional Neural Networks take advantage of the fact that the input consists of images and they constrain the architecture in a more sensible way. In particular, unlike a regular Neural Network, the layers of a ConvNet have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions: <strong>width, height, depth</strong>. (Note that the word <em>depth</em> here refers to the third dimension of an activation volume, not to the depth of a full Neural Network, which can refer to the total number of layers in a network.) For example, the input images in CIFAR-10 are an input volume of activations, and the volume has dimensions 32x32x3 (width, height, depth respectively). As we will soon see, the neurons in a layer will only be connected to a small region of the layer before it, instead of all of the neurons in a fully-connected manner. Moreover, the final output layer would for CIFAR-10 have dimensions 1x1x10, because by the end of the ConvNet architecture we will reduce the full image into a single vector of class scores, arranged along the depth dimension. Here is a visualization:</p>\n",

    "<p>The Conv layer is the core building block of a Convolutional Network that does most of the computational heavy lifting.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>Overview and intuition without brain stuff.</strong> Let’s first discuss what the CONV layer computes without brain/neuron analogies. The CONV layer’s parameters consist of a set of learnable filters. Every filter is small spatially (along width and height), but extends through the full depth of the input volume. For example, a typical filter on a first layer of a ConvNet might have size 5x5x3 (i.e. 5 pixels width and height, and 3 because images have depth 3, the color channels). During the forward pass, we slide (more precisely, convolve) each filter across the width and height of the input volume and compute dot products between the entries of the filter and the input at any position. As we slide the filter over the width and height of the input volume we will produce a 2-dimensional activation map that gives the responses of that filter at every spatial position. Intuitively, the network will learn filters that activate when they see some type of visual feature such as an edge of some orientation or a blotch of some color on the first layer, or eventually entire honeycomb or wheel-like patterns on higher layers of the network. Now, we will have an entire set of filters in each CONV layer (e.g. 12 filters), and each of them will produce a separate 2-dimensional activation map. We will stack these activation maps along the depth dimension and produce the output volume.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/conv_layer.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>Local Connectivity.</strong> When dealing with high-dimensional inputs such as images, as we saw above it is impractical to connect neurons to all neurons in the previous volume. Instead, we will connect each neuron to only a local region of the input volume. The spatial extent of this connectivity is a hyperparameter called the <strong>receptive field</strong> of the neuron (equivalently this is the filter size). The extent of the connectivity along the depth axis is always equal to the depth of the input volume. It is important to emphasize again this asymmetry in how we treat the spatial dimensions (width and height) and the depth dimension: The connections are local in space (along width and height), but always full along the entire depth of the input volume.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><em>Example 1</em>. For example, suppose that the input volume has size [32x32x3], (e.g. an RGB CIFAR-10 image). If the receptive field (or the filter size) is 5x5, then each neuron in the Conv Layer will have weights to a [5x5x3] region in the input volume, for a total of 5*5*3 = 75 weights (and +1 bias parameter). Notice that the extent of the connectivity along the depth axis must be 3, since this is the depth of the input volume.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><em>Example 2</em>. Suppose an input volume had size [16x16x20]. Then using an example receptive field size of 3x3, every neuron in the Conv Layer would now have a total of 3*3*20 = 180 connections to the input volume. Notice that, again, the connectivity is local in space (e.g. 3x3), but full along the input depth (20).</p>\n",

Each neuron in the convolutional layer is connected only to a local region in the input volume spatially, but to the full depth (i.e. all color channels). Note, there are multiple neurons (5 in this example) along the depth, all looking at the same region in the input - see discussion of depth columns in text below. <b>Right:</b> The neurons from the Neural Network chapter remain unchanged: They still compute a dot product of their weights with the input followed by a non-linearity, but their connectivity is now restricted to be local spatially.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>Spatial arrangement</strong>. We have explained the connectivity of each neuron in the Conv Layer to the input volume, but we haven’t yet discussed how many neurons there are in the output volume or how they are arranged. Three hyperparameters control the size of the output volume: the <strong>depth (number of filters), stride</strong> and <strong>zero-padding</strong>. We discuss these next:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "  <li>First, the <strong>depth (number of filters)</strong> of the output volume is a hyperparameter: it corresponds to the number of filters we would like to use, each learning to look for something different in the input. For example, if the first Convolutional Layer takes as input the raw image, then different neurons along the depth dimension may activate in presence of various oriented edges, or blobs of color. We will refer to a set of neurons that are all looking at the same region of the input as a <strong>depth column</strong> (some people also prefer the term <em>fibre</em>).</li>\n",
    "  <li>Second, we must specify the <strong>stride</strong> with which we slide the filter. When the stride is 1 then we move the filters one pixel at a time. When the stride is 2 (or uncommonly 3 or more, though this is rare in practice) then the filters jump 2 pixels at a time as we slide them around. This will produce smaller output volumes spatially.</li>\n",
    "  <li>As we will soon see, sometimes it will be convenient to pad the input volume with zeros around the border. The size of this <strong>zero-padding</strong> is a hyperparameter. The nice feature of zero padding is that it will allow us to control the spatial size of the output volumes (most commonly as we’ll see soon we will use it to exactly preserve the spatial size of the input volume so the input and output width and height are the same).</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>We can compute the spatial size of the output volume as a function of the input volume size (\\(W\\)), the receptive field size of the Conv Layer neurons (\\(F\\)), the stride with which they are applied (\\(S\\)), and the amount of zero padding used (\\(P\\)) on the border. You can convince yourself that the correct formula for calculating how many neurons “fit” is given by \\((W - F + 2P)/S + 1\\). For example for a 7x7 input and a 3x3 filter with stride 1 and pad 0 we would get a 5x5 output. With stride 2 we would get a 3x3 output.</p>\n",

This is generally a good idea for larger and deeper networks, because multiple stacked CONV layers can develop more complex features of the input volume before the destructive pooling operation.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><em>Prefer a stack of small filter CONV to one large receptive field CONV layer</em>. Suppose that you stack three 3x3 CONV layers on top of each other (with non-linearities in between, of course). In this arrangement, each neuron on the first CONV layer has a 3x3 view of the input volume. A neuron on the second CONV layer has a 3x3 view of the first CONV layer, and hence by extension a 5x5 view of the input volume. Similarly, a neuron on the third CONV layer has a 3x3 view of the 2nd CONV layer, and hence a 7x7 view of the input volume. Suppose that instead of these three layers of 3x3 CONV, we only wanted to use a single CONV layer with 7x7 receptive fields. These neurons would have a receptive field size of the input volume that is identical in spatial extent (7x7), but with several disadvantages. First, the neurons would be computing a linear function over the input, while the three stacks of CONV layers contain non-linearities that make their features more expressive. Second, if we suppose that all the volumes have \\(C\\) channels, then it can be seen that the single 7x7 CONV layer would contain \\(C \\times (7 \\times 7 \\times C) = 49 C^2\\) parameters, while the three 3x3 CONV layers would only contain \\(3 \\times (C \\times (3 \\times 3 \\times C)) = 27 C^2\\) parameters. Intuitively, stacking CONV layers with tiny filters as opposed to having one CONV layer with big filters allows us to express more powerful features of the input, and with fewer parameters. As a practical disadvantage, we might need more memory to hold all the intermediate CONV layer results if we plan to do backpropagation.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>Recent departures.</strong> It should be noted that the conventional paradigm of a linear list of layers has recently been challenged, in Google’s Inception architectures and also in current (state of the art) Residual Networks from Microsoft Research Asia. Both of these (see details below in case studies section) feature more intricate and different connectivity structures.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><strong>In practice: use whatever works best on ImageNet</strong>. If you’re feeling a bit of a fatigue in thinking about the architectural decisions, you’ll be pleased to know that in 90% or more of applications you should not have to worry about these. I like to summarize this point as “<em>don’t be a hero</em>”: Instead of rolling your own architecture for a problem, you should look at whatever architecture currently works best on ImageNet, download a pretrained model and finetune it on your data. You should rarely ever have to train a ConvNet from scratch or design one from scratch. I also made this point at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6aEYuemt0M\">Deep Learning school</a>.</p>\n"

    "<h2 id=\"layer-sizing-patterns\">3.2. Layer Sizing Patterns</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Until now we’ve omitted mentions of common hyperparameters used in each of the layers in a ConvNet. We will first state the common rules of thumb for sizing the architectures and then follow the rules with a discussion of the notation:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The <strong>input layer</strong> (that contains the image) should be divisible by 2 many times. Common numbers include 32 (e.g. CIFAR-10), 64, 96 (e.g. STL-10), or 224 (e.g. common ImageNet ConvNets), 384, and 512.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The <strong>conv layers</strong> should be using small filters (e.g. 3x3 or at most 5x5), using a stride of \\(S = 1\\), and crucially, padding the input volume with zeros in such way that the conv layer does not alter the spatial dimensions of the input. That is, when \\(F = 3\\), then using \\(P = 1\\) will retain the original size of the input. When \\(F = 5\\), \\(P = 2\\). For a general \\(F\\), it can be seen that \\(P = (F - 1) / 2\\) preserves the input size. If you must use bigger filter sizes (such as 7x7 or so), it is only common to see this on the very first conv layer that is looking at the input image.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The <strong>pool layers</strong> are in charge of downsampling the spatial dimensions of the input. The most common setting is to use max-pooling with 2x2 receptive fields (i.e. \\(F = 2\\)), and with a stride of 2 (i.e. \\(S = 2\\)). Note that this discards exactly 75% of the activations in an input volume (due to downsampling by 2 in both width and height). Another slightly less common setting is to use 3x3 receptive fields with a stride of 2, but this makes. It is very uncommon to see receptive field sizes for max pooling that are larger than 3 because the pooling is then too lossy and aggressive. This usually leads to worse performance.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><em>Reducing sizing headaches.</em> The scheme presented above is pleasing because all the CONV layers preserve the spatial size of their input, while the POOL layers alone are in charge of down-sampling the volumes spatially. In an alternative scheme where we use strides greater than 1 or don’t zero-pad the input in CONV layers, we would have to very carefully keep track of the input volumes throughout the CNN architecture and make sure that all strides and filters “work out”, and that the ConvNet architecture is nicely and symmetrically wired.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><em>Why use stride of 1 in CONV?</em> Smaller strides work better in practice. Additionally, as already mentioned stride 1 allows us to leave all spatial down-sampling to the POOL layers, with the CONV layers only transforming the input volume depth-wise.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><em>Why use padding?</em> In addition to the aforementioned benefit of keeping the spatial sizes constant after CONV, doing this actually improves performance. If the CONV layers were to not zero-pad the inputs and only perform valid convolutions, then the size of the volumes would reduce by a small amount after each CONV, and the information at the borders would be “washed away” too quickly.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><em>Compromising based on memory constraints.</em> In some cases (especially early in the ConvNet architectures), the amount of memory can build up very quickly with the rules of thumb presented above. For example, filtering a 224x224x3 image with three 3x3 CONV layers with 64 filters each and padding 1 would create three activation volumes of size [224x224x64]. This amounts to a total of about 10 million activations, or 72MB of memory (per image, for both activations and gradients). Since GPUs are often bottlenecked by memory, it may be necessary to compromise. In practice, people prefer to make the compromise at only the first CONV layer of the network. For example, one compromise might be to use a first CONV layer with filter sizes of 7x7 and stride of 2 (as seen in a ZF net). As another example, an AlexNet uses filter sizes of 11x11 and stride of 4.</p>\n"

    "<p>There are several architectures in the field of Convolutional Networks that have a name. The most common are:</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li><strong>LeNet</strong>. The first successful applications of Convolutional Networks were developed by Yann LeCun in 1990’s. Of these, the best known is the <a href=\"http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-98.pdf\">LeNet</a> architecture that was used to read zip codes, digits, etc.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>AlexNet</strong>. The first work that popularized Convolutional Networks in Computer Vision was the <a href=\"http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks\">AlexNet</a>, developed by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever and Geoff Hinton. The AlexNet was submitted to the <a href=\"http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2014/\">ImageNet ILSVRC challenge</a> in 2012 and significantly outperformed the second runner-up (top 5 error of 16% compared to runner-up with 26% error). The Network had a very similar architecture to LeNet, but was deeper, bigger, and featured Convolutional Layers stacked on top of each other (previously it was common to only have a single CONV layer always immediately followed by a POOL layer).</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>ZF Net</strong>. The ILSVRC 2013 winner was a Convolutional Network from Matthew Zeiler and Rob Fergus. It became known as the <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901\">ZFNet</a> (short for Zeiler &amp; Fergus Net). It was an improvement on AlexNet by tweaking the architecture hyperparameters, in particular by expanding the size of the middle convolutional layers and making the stride and filter size on the first layer smaller.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>GoogLeNet</strong>. The ILSVRC 2014 winner was a Convolutional Network from <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842\">Szegedy et al.</a> from Google. Its main contribution was the development of an <em>Inception Module</em> that dramatically reduced the number of parameters in the network (4M, compared to AlexNet with 60M). Additionally, this paper uses Average Pooling instead of Fully Connected layers at the top of the ConvNet, eliminating a large amount of parameters that do not seem to matter much. There are also several followup versions to the GoogLeNet, most recently <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261\">Inception-v4</a>.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>VGGNet</strong>. The runner-up in ILSVRC 2014 was the network from Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman that became known as the <a href=\"http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/\">VGGNet</a>. Its main contribution was in showing that the depth of the network is a critical component for good performance. Their final best network contains 16 CONV/FC layers and, appealingly, features an extremely homogeneous architecture that only performs 3x3 convolutions and 2x2 pooling from the beginning to the end. Their <a href=\"http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/\">pretrained model</a> is available for plug and play use in Caffe. A downside of the VGGNet is that it is more expensive to evaluate and uses a lot more memory and parameters (140M). Most of these parameters are in the first fully connected layer, and it was since found that these FC layers can be removed with no performance downgrade, significantly reducing the number of necessary parameters.</li>\n",
    "  <li><strong>ResNet</strong>. <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385\">Residual Network</a> developed by Kaiming He et al. was the winner of ILSVRC 2015. It features special <em>skip connections</em> and a heavy use of <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167\">batch normalization</a>. The architecture is also missing fully connected layers at the end of the network. The reader is also referred to Kaiming’s presentation (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PGLj-uKT1w\">video</a>, <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kahe/ilsvrc15/ilsvrc2015_deep_residual_learning_kaiminghe.pdf\">slides</a>), and some <a href=\"https://github.com/gcr/torch-residual-networks\">recent experiments</a> that reproduce these networks in Torch. ResNets are currently by far state of the art Convolutional Neural Network models and are the default choice for using ConvNets in practice (as of May 10, 2016). In particular, also see more recent developments that tweak the original architecture from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027\">Kaiming He et al. Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks</a> (published March 2016).</li>\n",
